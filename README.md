This program converts text files between different encodings.
It will convert files from utf-8, to utf-16 little endian 
or big endian and from utf-16 LE to BE or BE to LE. This will
function independent of the endianness of the machine it is
running on. Has been tested on SPARC OS to get experience in
cross-platform development in C.
